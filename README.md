# Time Series Forecasting using Auto ARIMA and Prophet
<br>
This repo contains the Time Series Forecasting using Auto ARIMA and Prophet project as part of my data science portfolio. The objective is to forecast international airline passengers using a dataset from Kaggle.

## <a name="problem">Problem Statement</a>
This project is implemented to explore different time series modelling techniques on a relatively simple and clean dataset. The dataset contains 12 years of international airline passengers from 1941 to 1960. The data will be split into training (1949-1957) and validation (1958-1960) sets according to the ratio of 75:25. The training set (9 years) will be used to forecast for 3 years ahead and then compare with the actual validation data. Errors will be calculated in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

## <a name="data">Dataset</a>
The dataset used in this project is [International airline passengers](https://www.kaggle.com/andreazzini/international-airline-passengers) downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andreazzini/international-airline-passengers). It contains monthly total number of passengers (in thousands) and has two columns â€“ month and count of passengers.

## <a name="conclusion">Discussion and Conclusion</a> #
Comparing the time series models, Prophet performed significantly better than Auto ARIMA in forecasting the International airline passengers with the lowest RMSE. There is a clear seasonality pattern with a spike in the middle of the year (Jun-July) and Prophet has succesfully captured this pattern as seen in the component graph. However, this seasonality is not a constant additive factor, rather it grows with the trend i.e. multiplicative seasonality. Prophet can model multiplicative seasonality and thus produce impressive results in this dataset.
